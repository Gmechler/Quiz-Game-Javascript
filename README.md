# Quiz-Game-Javascript
I have learned a lot about javascript working on the project but I have talked with two TA's, my instructor, and a senior developer for apple who have not been able to figure out why my question will not increment. I have spent days trying to figure out this bug. From what I can tell, I am not able to grab on to the choices buttons after they are dynamically created. i have tried many dozens of approches with little results. Unfortunatly, this issues took up considerable time and leave the rest of the program non functioning. so i was not able to work and test the other functionalities.
